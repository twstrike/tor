  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Ensure that worker threads actually exit when a fatal error or
      shutdown is indicated. This doesn't currently affect the behaviour
      of Tor, because Tor never indicates fatal error or shutdown except
      in its unit tests. Fixes bug 16868; bugfix on 0.2.6.3-alpha.
